# hello-world
It's a crazy ole world
Here's a bit about myself.  I'm a theater carpenter out of work after I decided to switch to film and then a virus came and both industries collapsed and artists were deemed non-essential and Trump killed 100000 people by ignoring the virus and making it's existence a political tool.  Now I'm trying to learn how to be a data analyist so I can work again, hopefully from home, and move somewhere with more trees and mountains than nyc.
